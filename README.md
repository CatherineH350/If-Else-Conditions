## If/Elif/Else Conditional Statements
Used for decision-making operations with conditions

Conditional statments always start with an 
`if` header
`elif` optional, but we can have as many as we want
`else` optional, but only one for every `if`

### Condition:
An expression that evaluates to produce a result which is a Boolean value (AKA. Boolean expression)

### Indentation:
Python relies on indentation to define scope in the code

### Formula
if (Condition):
> Body Statement

elif (Condition):
> Body Statement

else: 
> Body Statement 

```
*Ex.*
a = 2
if (a == 0):
 print ("hi")
else:
 print ("bye")

```
>bye 

## Nested Conditional Statements 

A conditional statement inside another conditional statement.

### Indentation 
The header/clause of a nested conditional statement must be indented from an outer header

### Formula

```
if(Condition):
 if(Condition): <-- Starting a nested statement
   Body Statement 
 elif(Condition):
   Body Statement
 else:
   Body Statement <-- End of nested statement 
elif(Condition)
 Body statement
else: 
 Body Statement

```
#### *Ex.*
```
x=10
y=10
if (x < y):
 print("x is less than y")
else:
 if(x > y):
   print("x is greater than y")
 else:
   print("x and y are equal")
```
 > x and y are equal.
